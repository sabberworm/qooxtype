# qooxtype

qx2ts is a small node.js utility that takes a folder full of JSON files (as generated by qooxdooâ€™s `./generate.py api` command) and turns them into a TypeScript declaration source file.

It also contains some useful aliases for the types used by qooxdoo itself.

Note: This has to be reworked considerably in order to produce usable .d.ts files.

## Usage

run `node qx2ts /path/to/qooxdoo/app [generated-file-name.d.ts]`. When leaving out the output file name, output goes to ./appname.d.ts. The builder is special-cased not to output `framework` when used with the qooxdoo source but take the name of the parent folder (`qooxdoo-v-sdk.d.ts`).

## Known issues

* Some qooxdoo classes extend Error, which is not a legal class type in TS.
* Return and argument types in the qooxdoo API are not always correctly scoped. qooxtype does not yet fix these.
* Overloaded methods do not yet work.

## License

qooxtype is freely distributable under the terms of an MIT-style license.
